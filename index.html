                    A note from Google and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai
                </div>
                <div>
                    Every technology shift is an opportunity to advance scientific discovery, accelerate human progress,
                    and
                    improve lives. I believe the transition we are seeing right now with AI will be the most profound in
                    our
                    lifetimes, far bigger than the shift to mobile or to the web before it. AI has the potential to
                    create
                    opportunities — from the everyday to the extraordinary — for people everywhere. It will bring new
                    waves
                    of innovation and economic progress and drive knowledge, learning, creativity and productivity on a
                    scale we haven’t seen before.
                </div>
                <div>
                    That’s what excites me: the chance to make AI helpful for everyone, everywhere in the world.
                    Nearly eight years into our journey as an AI-first company, the pace of progress is only
                    accelerating:
                    Millions of people are now using generative AI across our products to do things they couldn’t even a
                    year ago, from finding answers to more complex questions to using new tools to collaborate and
                    create.
                    At the same time, developers are using our models and infrastructure to build new generative AI
                    applications, and startups and enterprises around the world are growing with our AI tools.

                    This is incredible momentum, and yet, we’re only beginning to scratch the surface of what’s
                    possible.
                </div>
                <div>
                    We’re approaching this work boldly and responsibly. That means being ambitious in our research and
                    pursuing the capabilities that will bring enormous benefits to people and society, while building in
                    safeguards and working collaboratively with governments and experts to address risks as AI becomes
                    more
                    capable. And we continue to invest in the very best tools, foundation models and infrastructure and
                    bring them to our products and to others, guided by our AI principles.

                    Now, we’re taking the next step on our journey with Gemini, our most capable and general model yet,
                    with
                    state-of-the-art performance across many leading benchmarks. Our first version, Gemini 1.0, is
                    optimized
                    for different sizes: Ultra, Pro and Nano. These are the first models of the Gemini era and the first
                    realization of the vision we had when we formed Google DeepMind earlier this year. This new era of
                    models represents one of the biggest science and engineering efforts we’ve undertaken as a company.
                    I’m
                    genuinely excited for what’s ahead, and for the opportunities Gemini will unlock for people
                    everywhere.

            <h2>Moment of the Year: One small jump for Neeraj, a giant leap for Indian javelin</h2>

            <p>
            <h5> Neeraj Chopra was, by far, the favourite for the gold ahead of the men's javelin throw final at the
                Hangzhou Asian Games.

                This was the reigning Olympic, World and Asian champion. He was expected steamroll his way to the top of
                the podium. And with his first throw, it looked like he was not only going to meet all those big
                expectations, but maybe even go a step further and breach the 90m barrier for the first time in his
                career.
                <div>
                    Then, the bizarre stuck. His first throw seemed to cross 86m, which would've been a great start.
                    Except
                    it didn't count. The officials did not measure his throw and after a pause for a few minutes, Neeraj
                    was
                    given another chance to fling the spear, which would be counted as his first throw.
                    Unfortunately, his next throw was underwhelming. In fact, his best after three throws was 84.49m --
                    and
                    the issue for his march-to-gold was that his compatriot Kishore Jena had taken a shock lead with an
                    effort of 86.77m in his third throw.
                </div>
                <div>
                    Out of nowhere, the champion was under quote a bit of pressure. It was not the start he (or us) had
                    been
                    expecting, and considering the circumstances of his first throw not counting, he had more than
                    enough
                    reason to feel frustrated. After all, in such situations it's tough to keep emotions in check. But
                    the
                    thing with Neeraj is that despite being one of us, he is also the best of us. When Jena took the
                    lead,
                    Neeraj gave him a big hug with a smiling face.
                </div>
                Then Neeraj walked in for his fourth throw. Another ordinary effort could've been the end... but this is
                Neeraj Chopra. When under pressure, he doesn't do ordinary.
